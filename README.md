This is a repository used for practicing Apache Spark, which is written in Scala.
There are multiple sections with multiple topics that I have covered, starting from basic things up to more advanced ones.
Each directory has hundreds of lines of code, with detailed explanations through comments.
I have also written and deployed a small aplication.
Directory "part7bigdata" is a project, in which I have analyzed the data of taxi drives in New York and based on it, answered crucial questions on how to improve the taxi business.
I have worked on figuring out what zones have most pickups/dropoffs, peak hours for taxi drives, length of drives and more.
For details, feel free to check out the code.
